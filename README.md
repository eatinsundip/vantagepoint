# VantagePoint
Attack Surface Scanner with the main focus being discover and enumeration.

Main goal is to make this work very easily on any linux.

Different Distros may need special work but end goal is all linux will run fine.

Maybe a compiled version that is fire and forget but also alternatives like Bash, Python, or Go

A container would be cool but that is something else I would need to learn adn I want to start small.
